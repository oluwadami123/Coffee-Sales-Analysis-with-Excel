# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard-with-Excel

## Project Overview 

This Project aims to provide insights on the purchasing power of customers on the sales of coffee based on the types, roast type, and their sizes. I visualized all my insights using charts and graphs and i created an outstanding interactive dsashboard to facilitate data-driven recommendations and decision making.


## Data Sources 
The dataset used for my analysis was gotten from Kaggle, to access the dataset [click here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadkaiftahir/coffee-orders-data). The dataset contains three sheets named:
1. Orders
2. Customers Demograhics
3. Products

## Tools 

Excel : I used excel for the data preparation, data cleaning, data analysis and for creating the dashboard. I used Vlookup fromula in excel to lookup the custmoter's Name, Email, and Country using their respective customer ID. I used IndexMatching formula to get their purchased products, the types, sizes and their unit prices. I calculated the "Sales" for each customers by simply multiplying their total quantity and the Unit price for each product.



## Data Cleaning/Preparation 

For the data cleaning and preparation, i used the following steps:
1. Data loading and preparation
2. Handling missing values
3. Checked for duplicates
4. Data formatting

## Exploratory Data Analysis 

I used pivot table to solve and answer key questions like:
1. Total Sales across the month for each year.
2. Top 5 Customers with highest Sales.
3. Total Sales across the countries.
4. Total Sales of the types of Coffee over time.
